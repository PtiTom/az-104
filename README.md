# H1 title

There are no further content requirements for Architecture Guides, except to include the last few sections at the end, and to follow all general Azure Architecture Center content requirements.

The Architecture Guide template requires the following sections at the end of the article:
  
## Contributors

> (Expected, but this section is optional if all the contributors would prefer to not include it)

> Start with the explanation text (same for every article), in italics. Then include the "Principal authors" list and the "Additional contributors" list (if there are additional contributors) (all in plain text, not italics or bold). Link each contributor's name to the person's LinkedIn profile. After the name, place a pipe symbol ("|") with spaces, and then enter the person's title. We don't include the person's company, MVP status, or links to additional profiles. Implement this format:

*This article is maintained by Microsoft. It was originally written by the following contributors.*

Principal authors: > Only the primary authors. List them alphabetically, by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. If the article gets rewritten, keep the original authors and add in the new one(s).

 * [Author 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")
 * [Author 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")
 * > Continue for each primary author (even if there are 10 of them).

Other contributors: > Include contributing (but not primary) authors, major editors (not minor edits), and technical reviewers. List them alphabetically, by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. It's okay to add in newer contributors.

 * [Contributor 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")
 * [Contributor 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")

## Next steps

- Bulleted list of third-party and other Microsoft links.
- Links shouldn't include en-us locale unless they don't work without it.
- Links to Microsoft Learn content should be site-relative, for example (/azure/feature/article-name).
- Don't include trailing slash in any links.

## Related resources

- Links to related Azure Architecture Center articles.
- Links should be relative, for example (../../solution-ideas/articles/article-name.yml).
